# Exploring Manchester Marathon Data

This repo includes the data and a Jupyter Notebook to recreate two plots, exploring data from the Manchester Marathon using `pywaffle` and `seaborn`. 

### Plot 1
The first section of the notebook explores how more younger people are taking up marathons and how the age structure has changed for the Manchester Marathon from 2022 to 2024.

### Plot 2
The second section was a curiosity of mine as someone told me once that you reach peak marathon age in your mid-thirties. To explore this, I wanted to explore how split times vary over the duration of the race and across each of the age groups to see if this was true.

The purpose of this notebook is exploratory and so there may be mistakes/errors.
